        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">An online learning platform is a webspace or portal for 
            educational content and resources that offers a student everything they need in one place:
             lectures, resources, opportunities to meet and chat with other students, and more. It is also
              an excellent way for the student and the teacher to monitor student progress. The benefits of
               an online course platform are that both students and teachers can track the students’
                progress through the course material, and everything is neatly organized in one place. 
                Additionally, students may also have an option of interacting with each other on the 
                platform.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning
             out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the
              attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms.
               Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption 
               etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored,
               not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after 
               defence), the results aren’t actually visible.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Let's Build a World Together contains more songs celebrating the
             fairy tale romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy Sherrill's Phil 
             Spector-influenced production. Regardless of what the reality may have been, country fans 
             couldn't get enough of the pair who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene 
             Chadbourne of AllMusic astutely observes, "The chemistry that develops between partners in 
             a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the
              case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb.</p>
